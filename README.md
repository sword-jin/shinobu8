## shinobu8

shinobu8(Japanese Âøç) is a minimal implementation of the CHIP-8 interpreter in Rust.

üì¢: If you run this program in a linux server like me, you can't get a full experience, 
because in the linux server, the terminal is not support to capture the key release event.
Eventually, I tested this program in windows desktop and linux desktop, and it works well.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run --package shinobu8-tui -- --rom ./roms/15PUZZLE
```

press `ESC` to exit the program.
